# RGT-Arduino_USB_Steer
This project is to create steering buttons for Wahoo RGT using an Arduino Pro Micro (or Leonardo). The concept is to make the Arduino act as an plug & play HID USB keyboard and send the characters 'A' (left) and 'D' (right) commands. 




**Bill of Materials:**
* Arduino Pro Micro (a clone version will work and save you the money)
- Switch qty: 2 (any contact normally open will work, I've used a 5mm x 5mm tactile switch (not waterproof))
- Some wires
- USB A to micro USB cable (if your Arduino did not come with it)



**Schematic:**

Follow the schematic for the wiring connections.

**Other Notes:**
- Sample picture: tactile switch hot glued to a scrap plastic from food packaging
- Switch assembly is held onto the hood using elastic 
- Waterproofing the switch, you can use a small plastic bag or food wrap to seal it
- Cheap alternative to waterproof the Arduino is to put it into a kids food container (easily found at the dollar store)
